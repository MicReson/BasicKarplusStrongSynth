# BasicKarplusStrongSynth
------------------------------
 Basic polyphonic Karplus Strong Synth made in max/msp.
 
 It has basic functions of a simple karplus string synthesizer.
 
 **Beware of the delay lines, it can cause infinite feedback loops!**
 I used a limiter on the output of the synthesizer and capped most of the values 
 that could cause an infinite feedback loop, as a safety measure but beware that it gets really loud really fast.
